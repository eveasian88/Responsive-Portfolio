                    class="profile">

                <p>I am a <strong>strategic, analytical Linguist,</strong> with native fluency in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susye-weng-reeder">five
                    languages</a> and a passion for working with languages and language data.
                </p>

                <p>Most of my professional life has been spent as a teacher. I helped facilitate a 100% student pass
                    rate on the AP Spanish Language and Culture Exam for numerous years in a row, the only teacher at my
                    institution with such a high success rate. In addition to teaching, I also enjoy leading students on <a href="https://barcelona2018abbeyroad.weebly.com/">travel 
                    abroad</a> experiences.
                </p>

                <p>An accomplishment Iâ€™m most proud of is that many of my students stay in contact with me years after
                    graduation and tell me about their travel abroad experiences. I consider this a win because something in my
                    class made them curious about the world, they continued to learn and found their own passion in language.
                </p>

                <p> I welcome the opportunity to work with a company that will utilize my language training and
                    knowledge in computational linguistics. Working in an artificial intelligence role that would allow me to be
                    part of the future of language exploration is my dream job.</p>
