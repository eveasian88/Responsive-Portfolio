      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="./images/Enlight382.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I am a <strong>strategic, analytical Linguist,</strong> with native fluency in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susye-weng-reeder">five languages</a> and a passion for working with languages and language data. I helped facilitate a 100% student pass rate on the AP Spanish Language and Culture Exam for numerous years in a row, the only teacher at my institution with such a high success rate. One of my proudest achievement was winning Teacher of the Year after a less than ideal year teaching following the Santa Rosa wildfires in October 2017.</p>
      
      <p>I welcome the opportunity to work with a company that will utilize my language training and knowledge in computational linguistics. Working in an artificial intelligence role that would allow me to be part of the future of language exploration is my dream job.</p>

      <p>Full Stack Web Developer who found a love for programming through Languages. I am both passionate about the technology being used and the opportunity to build and work with it. I have a strong understanding of both front end and back end technologies including Node.js, Express, React, Bootstrap, MySql, MongoDb and more. I am currently searching for my first opportunity in web development to demonstrate my knowledge and continue my growth in this ever-changing industry.</p>
