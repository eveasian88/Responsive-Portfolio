      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="./images/Enlight382.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I am a <strong>strategic, analytical Linguist,</strong> with native fluency in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susye-weng-reeder">five languages</a> and a passion for working with languages and language data.</p>

      <p>Most of my professional life has been spent as a teacher. I helped facilitate a 100% student pass rate on the AP Spanish Language and Culture Exam for numerous years in a row, the only teacher at my institution with such a high success rate. In addition to teaching, I also enjoy leading students on <a href="https://barcelona2018abbeyroad.weebly.com/">travel abroad</a> experiences.</p>

      <p>An accomplishment Iâ€™m most proud of is that many of my students stay in contact with me years after graduation and tell me about their travel abroad experiences. I consider this a win because something in my class made them curious about the world, they continued to learn and found their own passion in language.</p>
      
      <p>I welcome the opportunity to work with a company that will utilize my language training and knowledge in computational linguistics. Working in an artificial intelligence role that would allow me to be part of the future of language exploration is my dream job.</p>
